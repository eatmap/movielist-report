## MovieList

Project report for MovieList.

### Requirements

The project topic and functionality were open-ended. The goal was to use the experience gained from Project 1 to create a new application.

### Plan

We decided to make a web application allowing a user to make a watch list of movies. The system would require a user to login/register to the application before granting access to the movie search and watch list. Given the project time period of around one month, our primary goal was to create a working prototype with the basic functionality. Other goals for the project included practicing the software development cycle (specifically Agile methodology), building upon our teamwork and collaboration skills, and using the various software tools we have learned in class as well as other tools not used in the previous project.
